# BEC_Detection

The goal here is to extract a ROI from an experimentally obtained image that may contain 1-9 BEC (or thermal) clouds.  This allows for a speedup in computations involving peak fitting to extract numerical parameters (such as widths/positions/atom number).

This uses the Matterport Mask_RCNN algorithm.  Training data are hand labeled using the online VGG annotator.
